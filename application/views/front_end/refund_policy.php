                original payment method or receive in-store credit for the return amount.<br> 
                2. Customers who wish to exchange their purchase can choose to receive store credit instead of product. <br>
                3. Products once purchased can be exchanged or requested to refund only once. safetylensusa.com reserves the right to limit the number of returns and/or exchanges at any 
                point of time. <br>
